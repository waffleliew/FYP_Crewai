    "content": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\n\nThe following \u201crisk factors\u201d could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, operations, reputation, financial position or future financial performance. Some of the factors, events and contingencies discussed below may have occurred in the past, but the disclosures below are not representations as to whether or not the factors, events or contingencies have occurred in the past, and instead reflect our beliefs and opinions as to the factors, events, or contingencies that could materially and adversely affect us in the future. You should carefully consider each of the following risk factors and the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Company faces risks other than those listed here, including those that are unknown to the Company and others of which the Company may be aware but, at present, considers immaterial. Because of the following factors, as well as other variables affecting the Company\u2019s operating results, past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\n\n13\n\n* * *\n\nSTRATEGIC RISK FACTORS\n\n1.\n\nThe Company\u2019s risk management framework could prove inadequate, which could adversely affect the Company\n\nThe Company\u2019s risk management framework is designed to identify, monitor and mitigate risks that could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition or reputation. This framework includes departments or groups dedicated to enterprise risk management, treasury management, information security, model risk management, disaster recovery and other information technology-related risks, business continuity, legal and compliance, compensation structures and other human resources matters, vendor management and internal audit, among others. Many of the processes overseen by these departments function at the enterprise level, but many also function through, or rely to a certain degree upon, risk mitigation efforts in local operating groups. This is especially the case with respect to the Company\u2019s operations outside of the United States and recently acquired businesses, which may not be fully integrated into the Company\u2019s risk management framework. Similarly, with respect to the risks the Company assumes in the ordinary course of its business through the issuance of title insurance policies and the provision of related products and services, the Company employs localized, as well as centralized risk mitigation efforts. These efforts include the implementation of underwriting policies and procedures, automated underwriting and other risk-decisioning tools and other mechanisms for assessing and managing risk. Underwriting title insurance policies and making other risk-assumption decisions frequently involves a substantial degree of individual judgment and, accordingly, underwriters are maintained at the state, regional, divisional, and corporate levels with varying degrees of underwriting authority. These individuals may be encouraged by customers or others to assume risks or to expeditiously make risk determinations. If the Company\u2019s risk mitigation efforts prove inadequate, the Company could be adversely affected.\n\n2.\n\nThe Company is pursuing various innovative initiatives, which could result in increased title claims or otherwise adversely affect the Company\n\nIn an effort to speed the delivery of its products, increase efficiency, improve quality, improve the customer experience and decrease risk, the Company is utilizing innovative technologies, processes and techniques, including artificial intelligence, in the production and delivery of its products and services. These efforts include converting certain manual processes into automated ones to streamline searches, examinations and other underwriting functions in connection with the issuance of title insurance policies, building and maintaining title plants and other data assets, and digitizing and automating components of the settlement process. The Company believes these innovations will improve the customer experience by simplifying and reducing the time it takes to close a transaction, reduce risk and improve communication, and expects to continue expanding its use of these technologies. Risks from these and other innovative initiatives include those associated with potential defects in the design and development of the technologies used to automate processes; misapplication of technologies; the reliance on data, rules or assumptions that may prove inadequate; increased costs from third parties on whose technologies we are dependent; information security vulnerabilities; and failure to meet customer expectations, among others. As a result of these risks, the Company could experience increased claims, reputational damage or other adverse effects, which could be material to the Company.\n\n3.\n\nPotentially disruptive innovation in the real estate industry and/or the Company\u2019s participation in these efforts could adversely affect the Company\n\nIn addition to the Company\u2019s innovative activities, other participants in the real estate industry are seeking to innovate in ways that could adversely impact the Company\u2019s businesses. These participants include certain of the Company\u2019s sources of business, competitors, investments and ultimate customers. Innovations by these participants may change the demand for the Company\u2019s products and services, the manner in which the Company\u2019s products and services are ordered or fulfilled and the revenue or profitability derived from the Company\u2019s products and services. The Company\u2019s investments in some of these participants could also facilitate efforts that ultimately disrupt the Company\u2019s business or enable competitors. Accordingly, the Company\u2019s efforts to anticipate and participate in these transformations could require significant additional investment and management attention and may not succeed. These innovative efforts by third parties, and the manner in which the Company, its agents and other industry participants respond to them, could therefore have an adverse effect on the Company.\n\n14\n\n* * *\n\nOPERATIONAL RISK FACTORS\n\n4.\n\nConditions in the real estate market generally impact the demand for a substantial portion of the Company\u2019s products and services\n\nDemand for a substantial portion of the Company\u2019s products and services generally decreases as the number of real estate transactions in which its products and services are purchased decreases. The number of real estate transactions in which the Company\u2019s products and services are purchased typically decreases in the following situations, among others:\n\n\u2022\n\nwhen mortgage interest rates are high or rising;\n\n\u2022\n\nwhen the availability of credit, including commercial and residential mortgage funding, is limited;\n\n\u2022\n\nwhen real estate affordability is declining;\n\n\u2022\n\nwhen real estate inventory levels are insufficient or declining; and\n\n\u2022\n\nwhen economic conditions are unfavorable, including during periods of high unemployment.\n\nCertain of these circumstances, particularly when combined with declining real estate values and the increase in foreclosures that often results therefrom, also tend to adversely impact the Company\u2019s title claims experience. National inventory levels for residential homes for sale remain below historical average levels, and, combined with sustained high mortgage interest rates and elevated home prices, which decreased demand, contributed to historically weak residential purchase activity. Residential refinance activity is generally correlated with changes in mortgage interest rates and rising mortgage rates, beginning in 2022, expectedly had an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s refinance business that is expected to continue for so long as mortgage rates remain high relative to the interest rates of outstanding mortgages. Higher interest rates also negatively impacted commercial transactions beginning in the latter half of 2022 and will likely continue to impact our volumes, although activity levels have started to improve in recent quarters.\n\n5.\n\nUnfavorable economic conditions adversely affect the Company\n\nHistorically, uncertainty and negative trends in general economic conditions in the United States and abroad, including significant tightening of credit markets and/or a general decline in the value of real property, have created a difficult operating environment for the Company. These conditions also tend to negatively impact, and recently have impacted, the amount of funds the Company receives from third parties held in trust pending the closing of commercial and residential real estate transactions.\n\nThe Company deposits a substantial portion of these funds, as well as its own funds, with the federal savings bank it owns. During periods of unfavorable economic conditions, the return on these funds deposited at the Company\u2019s bank, as well as funds the Company deposits with third party financial institutions, tends to decline. In addition, the Company holds investments in entities, such as title agencies, settlement service providers and venture-stage companies, some of which have been negatively impacted by these conditions, as well as other securities in its investment portfolio, which also may be, and recently have been, negatively impacted by these conditions.\n\nCertain funds deposited at the Company\u2019s bank are invested into investment grade fixed income securities and any realized and unrealized losses on those investments will be reflected in the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements. The likelihood of such losses, which would generally not occur if the Company were to deposit these funds in an unaffiliated entity, increases when interest rates increase and/or when economic conditions are unfavorable.\n\nDepending upon the ultimate severity and duration of any economic downturn and other negative economic conditions, the resulting effects on the Company could be materially adverse, including a significant reduction in revenues, earnings and cash flows, higher claims, challenges to the Company\u2019s ability to satisfy covenants or otherwise meet its obligations under debt facilities and other contracts, difficulties in obtaining access to capital, challenges to the Company\u2019s ability to pay dividends at currently anticipated levels, deterioration in the value of or return on its investments and increased credit risk from customers and others with obligations to the Company.\n\n15\n\n* * *\n\n6.\n\nThe Company\u2019s use of models involves risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect the Company\n\nThe Company utilizes models to support decisions related to risk management, capital and liquidity planning, financial accounting, data extraction and other business purposes. Models are, by their nature, inherently limited due to their reliance on statistical, economic, financial or mathematical theories, techniques, data and assumptions that may be erroneous or inappropriate for the intended or actual use. Flawed models or uses of models, particularly those that rely on artificial intelligence, may result in, among other consequences, erroneous, biased or misleading outputs, imprudent business decisions, inadequate risk management or enhanced regulatory supervision. Heightened regulatory supervision and an evolving regulatory landscape could hinder the pace of the Company\u2019s innovation and may require burdensome changes to the Company\u2019s existing governance, processes and controls. These risks and uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and reputation.\n\n7.\n\nSevere weather conditions, health crises, terrorist attacks and other catastrophe events could adversely affect the Company\n\nSevere weather conditions, global or extensive health crises, terrorist attacks and other catastrophe events and responses to these events could adversely affect the Company. The extent to which these catastrophe events and responses to them impact the Company\u2019s business, operations and financial results will depend on numerous factors that the Company may not be able to accurately predict, including: the duration and scope of the catastrophe event and restrictions and responses to it; the impact of the catastrophe event on economic activity and actions taken in response, including the efficacy of governmental and other relief efforts or countermeasures; the effect on participants in real estate transactions and the demand for the Company\u2019s products and services.\n\nThe Company\u2019s home warranty business has been and may be impacted by increases in the frequency and severity of weather events. Home warranty claims, including those pertaining to HVAC systems, tend to rise as temperatures become extreme, especially in geographies where extreme temperatures are infrequent.\n\nIn addition, the Company manages its financial exposure for losses in its title insurance business with third-party reinsurance. Catastrophe events could adversely affect the cost and availability of that reinsurance. Moreover, to the extent severe weather conditions, health crises, terrorist attacks and other catastrophe events impact companies or municipalities whose securities the Company invests in, the value of its investments may also decrease due to these factors.\n\nThe frequency, severity, duration, and geographic location and scope of such health crises, catastrophe and severe weather events are inherently unpredictable, and, therefore, the Company is unable to predict the ultimate impact these events and responses to them will have on its businesses. The impacts of catastrophe events and responses to them may also exacerbate the risks discussed elsewhere in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report.\n\n8.\n\nThe Company may find it difficult to acquire necessary data\n\nCertain data used and supplied by the Company are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local regulatory authorities. Compliance with existing federal, state and local laws and regulations with respect to such data has not had a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations to date. Nonetheless, federal, state and local laws and regulations in the United States designed to protect the public from the misuse of personal information in the marketplace and adverse publicity or potential litigation concerning the commercial use of such information may affect the Company\u2019s operations and could result in substantial regulatory compliance expense, litigation expense and a loss of revenue. The suppliers of data to the Company face similar burdens. As a result of these and other factors, the Company may find it financially burdensome to acquire necessary data.\n\n9.\n\nChanges in the Company\u2019s relationships with large mortgage lenders or government\u2013sponsored enterprises could adversely affect the Company\n\nLarge mortgage lenders and government-sponsored enterprises, because of their significant role in the mortgage process, have significant influence over the Company and other service providers. Changes in the Company\u2019s relationship with any of these lenders or government-sponsored enterprises, the loss of all or a portion of the business the Company derives from these parties, any refusal of these parties to accept the Company\u2019s products and services, the modification of the government-sponsored enterprises\u2019 requirements for title insurance or mortgage servicing in connection with mortgages they purchase or the use of alternatives to the Company\u2019s products and services, could have a material adverse effect on the Company.\n\n16\n\n* * *\n\n10.\n\nA downgrade by ratings agencies, reductions in statutory capital and surplus maintained by the Company\u2019s title insurance underwriters or a deterioration in other measures of financial strength could adversely affect the Company\n\nCertain of the Company\u2019s customers use measurements of the financial strength of the Company\u2019s title insurance underwriters, including, among others, ratings provided by ratings agencies and levels of statutory capital and surplus maintained by those underwriters, in determining the amount of a policy they will accept and the amount of reinsurance required. Each of the major ratings agencies currently rates the Company\u2019s title insurance operations. These ratings provide the agencies\u2019 perspectives on the financial strength, operating performance and cash generating ability of those operations. These agencies continually review these ratings and the ratings are subject to change. Statutory capital and surplus, or the amount by which statutory assets exceed statutory liabilities, is also a measure of financial strength. Accordingly, if the ratings or statutory capital and surplus of these title insurance underwriters are reduced from their current levels, or if there is a deterioration in other measures of financial strength, the Company\u2019s results of operations, competitive position and liquidity could be adversely affected. In addition, a downgrade in the ratings or rankings for the Company\u2019s federal savings bank subsidiary or its mortgage servicing business could have an adverse effect on that particular business.\n\n11.\n\nThe issuance of the Company\u2019s title insurance policies and related activities by independent title agents could adversely affect the Company\n\nThe Company\u2019s title insurance subsidiaries issue a significant portion of their policies through title agents that usually operate with substantial independence from the Company. There is no guarantee that these title agents will fulfill their fiduciary duties or contractual obligations to the Company, which are designed to limit the Company\u2019s risk with respect to their activities. Certain activities that are not governed by fiduciary duties or contractual obligations to the Company can also create risks. If, for example, funds held in trust by an independent title agent are not appropriately applied by the agent in a transaction, it may result in one or more parties to a transaction having defective title to or lien on a property, which, in turn, has led to and may continue to lead to title claims against the Company for which the Company may be liable.\n\nIn addition, regulators are increasingly seeking to hold the Company responsible for the actions of these title agents and, under certain circumstances, the Company may be held liable directly to third parties for actions (including defalcations) or omissions of these agents. Case law and statutes in certain states also suggest that the Company is liable for the actions or omissions of its agents in those states, regardless of contractual limitations. As a result, the Company\u2019s use of title agents could result in increased claims and loss severity on the Company\u2019s policies issued through agents and an increase in other costs and expenses.\n\n12.\n\nSystems damage, failures, interruptions, cyberattacks and intrusions, and unauthorized data disclosures by the Company or its service providers may disrupt the Company\u2019s business, harm the Company\u2019s reputation, result in material claims for damages or otherwise adversely affect the Company\n\nThe Company uses computer software applications, systems and other technologies (collectively referred to as \u201csystems\u201d), some of which it owns and manages and some of which are owned and/or managed by third parties, including providers of Software as a Service (SaaS) and providers of distributed computing infrastructure platforms commonly known as the \u201ccloud.\u201d The Company and its agents, suppliers, service providers, and customers use systems to receive, process, store and transmit business information, including non-public personal information as well as data from suppliers and other information upon which the Company\u2019s business relies. The Company also uses these systems to manage substantial cash, investment assets, bank deposits, trust assets, escrow account balances and custodial balances on behalf of itself and its customers, among other activities. Many of the Company\u2019s products, services and solutions involving the use of real property related data are fully reliant on these systems and are only available electronically. Accordingly, for a variety of reasons, the integrity of these systems and the protection of the information that resides thereon are critically important to the Company\u2019s successful operation.\n\n17\n\n* * *\n\nThese systems have been subject to, and are likely to continue to be the target of, malware, cyberattacks and cyberterrorism, ransomware attacks, phishing attacks, unauthorized access, online and offline fraud and other malicious activity. These attacks are prevalent, continue to increase in frequency and sophistication, and are increasingly difficult to prevent or detect. These systems also have known and unknown vulnerabilities. Once identified, the Company\u2019s information technology and information security personnel seek to remediate these vulnerabilities based, in part, on the level of risk presented and the burden of remediation. For a number of reasons, including the introduction of new vulnerabilities, resource constraints, competing business demands and dependence on third parties, a number of unremediated vulnerabilities will always exist. Remediation of some vulnerabilities are outside of the control of the Company and third-party remediation efforts may not be timely provided or implemented or otherwise adequate, even when the level of risk is critical or high. Further, certain other potential causes of system damage or other negative system-related events are wholly or partially beyond the Company\u2019s control, such as natural disasters, vendor failures to satisfy service level requirements, third party negligence or intentional acts, and power or telecommunications failures. These circumstances could expose the Company to system-related damages, failures, interruptions, cyberattacks, as the Company experienced in December 2023 (as described further in Item 1C. Cybersecurity), and other negative events or could otherwise disrupt the Company\u2019s business and could also result in the loss or unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring or destruction of confidential, proprietary and other information pertaining to the Company, its customers, employees, agents or suppliers.\n\nIn conducting its business and delivering its products and services, the Company also utilizes service providers. These service providers and the systems they utilize are typically subject to similar types of system- and information security-related risks that the Company faces. The Company provides certain of these service providers with data, including nonpublic personal information. There is no guarantee that the Company\u2019s due diligence or ongoing vendor oversight will be sufficient to ensure the integrity and security of the systems utilized by these service providers or the protection of the information that resides thereon.\n\nCertain laws and contracts the Company has entered into require it to comply with certain information security requirements and to notify various parties, including consumers or customers, in the event of certain actual or potential data breaches or systems failures, including those of the Company\u2019s service providers. Further, the Company\u2019s financial institution customers have obligations to safeguard their systems and sensitive information and the Company may be bound contractually and/or by regulation to comply with the same requirements. If the Company or its service providers fail to comply with applicable regulations and contractual requirements, the Company could be exposed to lawsuits, governmental proceedings or the imposition of fines, among other consequences.\n\nAny inability of the Company or its service providers to prevent or adequately respond to the issues described above could disrupt the Company\u2019s business, delay the delivery of its products and services, inhibit its ability to retain existing customers or attract new customers, divert management\u2019s time and energy, otherwise harm its reputation and/or result in financial losses, litigation, regulatory inquiries, increased costs or other adverse consequences that could be material to the Company.\n\n13.\n\nErrors and fraud involving the transfer of funds may adversely affect the Company\n\nThe Company relies on its systems, employees and domestic and international banks to transfer its own funds and the funds of third parties. In addition to relying on third-party banks to transfer these funds, the Company\u2019s federal savings bank subsidiary transfers funds on behalf of the Company as well as title agents that are not affiliates of the Company. These transfers are susceptible to user input error, fraud, system interruptions, incorrect processing and similar errors that from time to time result in lost funds or delayed transactions. The Company\u2019s email and computer systems and systems used by its agents, customers and other parties involved in a transaction have been subject to, and are likely to continue to be the target of, fraudulent attacks, including attempts to cause the Company or its agents to improperly transfer funds. These attacks continue to increase in frequency and sophistication. Funds transferred to a fraudulent recipient may not be recoverable. In certain instances the Company may be liable for those unrecovered funds. The controls and procedures used by the Company to prevent transfer errors and fraud may prove inadequate, resulting in financial losses, reputational harm, loss of customers or other adverse consequences which could be material to the Company.\n\n14.\n\nThe Company\u2019s failure to recruit and retain qualified employees may adversely affect the business\n\nThe Company\u2019s continued success depends, in large part, on its ability to hire and retain qualified people. Competition for highly qualified people is significant, and there is no assurance that the Company will be successful in attracting, training or retaining people. If the Company is unable to attract and retain qualified people, its business and operations may be impaired or disrupted.\n\n18\n\n* * *\n\n15.\n\nThe Company\u2019s use of a global workforce involves risks that could adversely affect the Company\n\nThe Company utilizes lower cost labor in countries such as India and the Philippines, among others. These countries are subject to relatively high degrees of political and social instability and may lack the infrastructure to withstand natural disasters, health crises and other catastrophe events. Such disruptions could decrease efficiency and increase the Company\u2019s costs. Weakness of the United States dollar in relation to the currencies used in these countries may also reduce the savings achievable through this strategy. Laws, regulations, business requirements or social or political pressures may require the Company to use labor based in the United States or may otherwise effectively increase the Company\u2019s labor costs abroad. The Company may not be able to pass on these increased costs to its customers.\n\n16.\n\nAcquisitions may have an adverse effect on our business\n\nThe Company has in the past acquired, and is expected to acquire in the future, other businesses. When businesses are acquired, the Company may not be able to integrate or manage these businesses in such a manner as to realize the anticipated synergies or otherwise produce returns that justify the investment. Acquired businesses may subject the Company to increased regulatory or compliance requirements. The Company\u2019s acquisitions have involved, and may continue to involve, the entry into businesses in which the Company\u2019s management has limited prior experience, making the Company reliant on the management team of the acquired business. The Company may not be able to successfully retain employees of acquired businesses or integrate them, and could lose customers, suppliers or other partners as a result of the acquisitions. The Company may also assume or incur unanticipated liabilities from acquisitions. For these and other reasons, including changes in market conditions, the projections used to value the acquired businesses may prove inaccurate. These and other factors related to acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. The Company\u2019s management also will continue to be required to dedicate substantial time and effort to the integration of its acquisitions. These efforts could divert management\u2019s focus and resources from other strategic opportunities and operational matters.\n\nLEGAL AND COMPLIANCE RISK FACTORS\n\n17.\n\nRegulatory oversight and changes in government regulation could require the Company to raise capital, make it more difficult to deploy capital, including dividends to stockholders and repurchases of the Company\u2019s shares, prohibit or limit the Company\u2019s operations, make it more costly or burdensome to conduct such operations, result in decreased demand for the Company\u2019s products and services or otherwise adversely affect the Company\n\nMost of the Company\u2019s businesses are regulated by various federal, state, local and foreign governmental agencies. These and other of the Company\u2019s businesses also operate within statutory guidelines, which can include requirements to maintain certain licenses at the federal, state and/or local levels. The industry in which the Company operates and the markets into which it sells its products are also regulated and subject to statutory guidelines. In general, in recent years, the Company experienced increasing regulatory oversight and became subject to increasingly complex statutory guidelines.\n\nRegulatory oversight could require the Company to raise capital, and/or make it more difficult to deploy capital, including dividends to stockholders and repurchases of the Company\u2019s shares. It is possible that the group capital calculations, particularly in an economic downturn, could have the effect of requiring the Company to raise capital and/or making it more difficult to otherwise deploy capital, including dividends to stockholders and repurchases of the Company\u2019s shares.\n\nAn increasing number of federal, state, and international laws and regulations apply to the collection, use, retention, protection, disclosure, transfer, and other processing of personal data. The effects of these privacy and data protection laws, including the cost of compliance and required changes in the manner in which the Company conducts its business, are not fully known and are potentially significant, and the failure to comply could adversely affect the Company. The Company has incurred costs to comply with these laws and to respond to inquiries about its compliance with them.\n\n19\n\n* * *\n\nIn addition, changes in the applicable regulatory environment, statutory guidelines or interpretations of existing regulations or statutes; reform of government-sponsored enterprises such as the Federal National Mortgage Association (\u201cFannie Mae\u201d) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (\u201cFreddie Mac\u201d); enhanced governmental oversight or efforts by governmental agencies to cause customers to refrain from using the Company\u2019s products or services could prohibit or limit its future operations or make it more costly or burdensome to conduct such operations or result in decreased demand for the Company\u2019s products and services or a change in its competitive position. The impact of these changes would be more significant if they involve jurisdictions in which the Company generates a greater portion of its title premiums, such as the states of Arizona, California, Florida, New York, and Texas. These changes may compel the Company to reduce its prices, may restrict its ability to implement price increases or acquire assets or businesses, may limit the manner in which the Company conducts its business or otherwise may have a negative impact on its ability to generate revenues, earnings and cash flows.\n\n18.\n\nScrutiny of the Company\u2019s businesses and the industries in which it operates by governmental entities and others could adversely affect the Company\n\nThe real estate settlement services industry, an industry in which the Company generates a substantial portion of its revenue and earnings, and the mortgage servicing and subservicing industry are subject to continuous scrutiny by regulators, legislators, the media and plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys. Though often directed at these industries generally, these groups also focus their attention directly on the Company\u2019s businesses from time to time. In either case, this scrutiny may result in changes which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s operations and, therefore, its financial condition and liquidity.\n\nGovernmental entities have routinely inquired into certain practices in the real estate settlement services industry and the mortgage servicing and subservicing industry to determine whether certain of the Company\u2019s businesses or its competitors have violated applicable laws, which include, among others, the insurance codes of the various jurisdictions, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Truth in Lending Act and similar state, federal and foreign laws. The CFPB, for example, has actively utilized its regulatory authority over the mortgage and real estate markets by bringing enforcement actions against various participants in the mortgage and settlement industries. Departments of insurance in the various states, the CFPB and other federal regulators and applicable regulators in international jurisdictions, either separately or together, also periodically conduct targeted inquiries into the practices of title insurance companies, other settlement services providers and mortgage servicers in their respective jurisdictions. Currently, the Company is the subject of regulatory inquiries.\n\nFurther, from time to time, plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers have targeted, and are expected to continue to target, the Company and other members of the Company\u2019s industry with lawsuits claiming legal violations or other wrongful conduct. These lawsuits often involve large groups of plaintiffs and claims for substantial damages. These types of inquiries or proceedings have from time to time resulted, and may in the future result, in findings of a violation of the law or other wrongful conduct and the payment of fines or damages or the imposition of restrictions on the Company\u2019s conduct. This could impact the Company\u2019s operations and financial condition. Moreover, these laws and standards of conduct often are ambiguous and, thus, it may be difficult to ensure compliance. This ambiguity may force the Company to mitigate its risk by settling claims or by ending practices that generate revenues, earnings and cash flows. Currently the Company is a party to class action lawsuits.\n\n19.\n\nRegulation of title insurance rates could adversely affect the Company\n\nTitle insurance rates are subject to extensive regulation, which varies from state to state. In many states the approval of the applicable state insurance regulator is required prior to implementing a rate change. These regulations could hinder the Company\u2019s ability to promptly adapt to changing market dynamics through price adjustments, which could adversely affect its results of operations, particularly in a rapidly declining market.\n\n20\n\n* * *\n\nFINANCIAL RISK FACTORS\n\n20.\n\nFailures at financial institutions at which the Company deposits funds could adversely affect the Company\n\nThe Company deposits substantial funds in financial institutions. These funds include amounts owned by third parties, such as escrow deposits, like-kind exchange deposits and investor, mortgagor and subservicer deposits. Should one or more of the financial institutions at which deposits are maintained fail, there is no guarantee that the Company would recover the funds deposited, whether through Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation coverage or otherwise. In the event of any such failure, the Company also could be held liable for the funds owned by third parties. Unfavorable economic conditions may lead to a heightened risk of failures of financial institutions at which the Company maintains deposits. Failures may be difficult to predict and the Company may not be able to react in a sufficiently timely manner to avoid adverse effects on the Company.\n\n21.\n\nUnfavorable economic or other conditions could cause the Company to write off a portion of its goodwill and other intangible assets\n\nThe Company performs an impairment test of the carrying value of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets annually in the fourth quarter, or sooner if circumstances indicate a possible impairment. Finite-lived intangible assets are subject to impairment tests on a periodic basis. Factors that may be considered in connection with this review include, without limitation, underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, reductions in the Company\u2019s stock price and market capitalization, increased cost of capital and negative macroeconomic, industry and company-specific trends. These and other factors could lead to a conclusion that goodwill or other intangible assets are impaired, in which case the Company would be required to write off the portion believed to be impaired. Any substantial goodwill and other intangible asset impairments that may be required could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\n\n22.\n\nThe Company\u2019s investment portfolio is subject to certain risks and could experience losses\n\nThe Company maintains a substantial investment portfolio, primarily consisting of fixed income debt securities. The investment portfolio also includes adjustable-rate debt securities, common and preferred stock, as well as money-market and other short-term investments. Securities in the Company\u2019s investment portfolio are subject to certain economic and financial market risks, such as credit risk, interest rate (including call, prepayment and extension) risk and/or liquidity risk. The risk of loss associated with the portfolio is increased during periods of instability in credit markets and economic conditions. Debt and equity securities are carried at fair value on the Company\u2019s balance sheet. Changes in the fair values of debt securities are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income/loss on the balance sheet. For debt securities in an unrealized loss position, where the loss is determined to be due to credit-related factors, the Company records the loss in earnings. Changes in the fair values of marketable equity securities are recognized in earnings. Changes in the fair values of securities in the Company\u2019s investment portfolio have had an adverse impact on the Company and could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations, statutory surplus, financial condition and cash flow.\n\n23.\n\nThe Company\u2019s venture investment portfolio is volatile and subject to certain risks and could experience losses\n\nThe Company\u2019s venture investment portfolio is primarily comprised of investments in the equity of private venture-stage companies that operate in the real-estate industry and related industries (many of which offer technology-enabled products and services), investments in funds that typically invest in these same types of companies, and a similar investment that is trading publicly. The venture investment portfolio is managed independent of the Company\u2019s portfolio of debt securities and marketable equity securities, which is overseen by the Company\u2019s investment department and an investment committee. The Company may continue to make similar venture investments. These investments may cause material fluctuations in the Company\u2019s quarterly results of operations due to the recognition of gains or losses in connection with observable price changes, such as from liquidity events, impairments, subsequent equity sales, or price changes in investments that begin trading publicly, which changes can be volatile.\n\n21\n\n* * *\n\n24.\n\nActual claims experience could materially vary from the expected claims experience reflected in the Company\u2019s reserve for incurred but not reported claims\n\nThe Company maintains a reserve for incurred but not reported (\u201cIBNR\u201d) claims pertaining to its title, escrow and other insurance and guarantee products. The majority of this reserve pertains to title insurance policies, which are long-duration contracts with the majority of the claims reported within the first few years following the issuance of the policy. Generally, 65% to 75% of claim amounts become known in the first six years of the policy life, and the majority of IBNR reserves relate to the six most recent policy years. Changes in expected ultimate losses and corresponding loss rates for recent policy years are considered likely and could result in a material adjustment to the IBNR reserves. In uncertain economic times, an even larger change is more likely. A material change in expected ultimate losses and corresponding loss rates for older policy years is also possible, particularly for the ten most recent policy years. The estimates made by management in determining the appropriate level of IBNR reserves could ultimately prove to be materially different from actual claims experience.\n\nChanges in laws or regulations impacting real estate, particularly when applied retroactively, may cause a material change in expected ultimate losses and corresponding loss rates for recent and/or older policy years. For example, the 2020 United States Supreme Court decision in McGirt v. Oklahoma calls into question the governing authority for certain real estate-related matters in Native American reservations once thought to have been disestablished. To the extent the Company, in those areas, underwrote title insurance policies or closed real estate transactions in conformity with authority that ultimately proves inapplicable, expected ultimate losses arising from those policies and transactions could change materially and could result in a material change to loss rates.\n\n25.\n\nThe Company may have to provide capital to one or more of its subsidiaries, which may necessitate accessing funds from the Company\u2019s revolving credit facility or otherwise\n\nThe Company is a holding company and its subsidiaries, from time to time, may need additional capital from the Company to, for example, fund operations, meet regulatory requirements or pay liabilities. In order to provide such capital, the Company may need to draw down on its revolving credit facility or access other sources of capital, which could negatively affect its debt-to-capital ratio and liquidity position.\n\n26.\n\nThe Company's ability to fulfill parent company obligations and/or pay dividends may be limited\n\nThe Company is a holding company whose primary assets are investments in its operating subsidiaries. The Company\u2019s ability to fulfill parent company obligations and/or declare and pay dividends is dependent on the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends or repay funds. If the Company\u2019s operating subsidiaries are not able to pay dividends or repay funds, the Company may not be able to fulfill parent company obligations and/or declare and pay dividends. Moreover, pursuant to insurance and other regulations under which the Company\u2019s insurance subsidiaries operate, the amount of dividends, loans and advances available is limited. See Item 7 \u2013 MD&A \u2013 Liquidity and Capital Resources for details on dividend restrictions. The Company may also be required to invest capital in its subsidiaries which could further limit its ability to fulfill parent company obligations and/or declare and pay dividends.\n\n27.\n\nA reduction in the deposits at the Company\u2019s federal savings bank subsidiary could require the Company to borrow funds to maintain liquidity\n\nThe deposits of the Company\u2019s federal savings bank subsidiary consist almost entirely of funds deposited by its affiliates, the majority of which are from third parties to be held in trust pending the closing of real estate transactions. When real estate transactions decline, aggregate deposits held in trust at the Company\u2019s bank tend to decline. There is also a portion of the bank\u2019s deposits that are custodial funds held on behalf of clients of the Company\u2019s residential mortgage subservicer subsidiary. Such clients may cause their custodial funds to be moved out of the Company\u2019s bank subsidiary in connection with the transfer of ownership of mortgage servicing rights or loans, termination of subservicing contracts or otherwise. The likelihood of these clients causing funds to be moved increases as interest rates rise, which could result in a marked decline in the bank\u2019s deposits. When there is a reduction in the bank\u2019s deposits, the Company could be required to borrow funds to maintain the bank\u2019s liquidity.\n\n22\n\n* * *\n\nGENERAL RISK FACTORS\n\n28.\n\nCertain provisions of the Company\u2019s bylaws and certificate of incorporation, as well as regulatory hurdles, may reduce the likelihood of any unsolicited acquisition proposal or potential change of control that the Company\u2019s stockholders might consider favorable\n\nThe Company\u2019s bylaws and certificate of incorporation contain provisions that could be considered \u201canti-takeover\u201d provisions because they make it harder for a third-party to acquire the Company without the consent of the Company\u2019s incumbent board of directors. Under these provisions:\n\n\u2022\n\nelection of the Company\u2019s board of directors is staggered such that only three or four of the directors are elected by the stockholders each year and the directors serve three year terms prior to reelection;\n\n\u2022\n\nstockholders may not remove directors without cause, change the size of the board of directors or, except as may be provided for in the terms of preferred stock the Company issues in the future, fill vacancies on the board of directors;\n\n\u2022\n\nstockholders may act only at stockholder meetings and not by written consent;\n\n\u2022\n\nstockholders must comply with advance notice provisions for nominating directors or presenting other proposals at stockholder meetings; and\n\n\u2022\n\nthe Company\u2019s board of directors may without stockholder approval issue preferred shares and determine their rights and terms, including voting rights, or adopt a stockholder rights plan.\n\nWhile the Company believes that they are appropriate, these provisions may only be amended by the affirmative vote of the holders of approximately 67% of the Company\u2019s issued voting shares. In addition, federal banking laws and regulations and state insurance laws and regulations require third parties to obtain prior approval to acquire control of the Company due to its status as a savings and loan holding company and an insurance holding company. These provisions and regulatory requirements could have the effect of discouraging an unsolicited acquisition proposal or delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control transaction that might involve a premium price or otherwise be considered favorably by the Company\u2019s stockholders.\n\n29.\n\nThe Company may be susceptible to claims of infringement and may not be able to adequately protect its intellectual property\n\nThe Company relies on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secret laws, non-disclosure agreements, contractual provisions and systems of internal safeguards to protect its intellectual property. As the Company expands its utilization of innovative technologies, processes and techniques in the production and delivery of its products and services, the Company may increasingly have to litigate to enforce and protect its intellectual property rights, which may divert Company resources, cause reputational harm to the Company or result in other adverse consequences, including a loss of competitive advantage, and there is no guarantee that such protection and enforcement efforts would be successful. In addition, third parties may allege that the Company\u2019s operations or activities infringe on their intellectual property rights, including through the Company\u2019s use of software containing open source code, which may expose the Company to third-party claims of ownership of, or demands for the release of, the source code, the open source software and/or derivative works that were developed using such software, or otherwise seeking to enforce the terms of the applicable open source license. Many of the risks associated with usage of open source cannot be eliminated, and could, if not properly addressed, adversely affect the Company\u2019s business. Infringement claims may give rise to litigation, which could result in damages, injunctions prohibiting the Company from providing certain products or services, entry into costly licensing arrangements or other adverse consequences."
