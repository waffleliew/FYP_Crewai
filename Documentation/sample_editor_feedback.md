   Please consider the following feedback for the Investment Recommendation section:

         - **Next Day**: Maintain "Hold" recommendation due to robust financial health yet observe potential immediate impacts from market volatility.
         - **Next Week**: Transition to "Buy" contingent on favorable integration of Docutech acquisition and sustained refinance activity.
         - **Next Month**: Strong "Buy" as broader market trends solidify and the company cements its position in the tech-driven real estate landscape.
      - **Catalysts**: Highlight the strategic acquisition as a catalyst along with expectations of continued growth from digital transformation efforts.
