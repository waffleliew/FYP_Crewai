            "content": "Item 9A.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Controls and Procedures\n\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\n\nBased on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company\u2019s management, the Company\u2019s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act were effective as of September\u00a028, 2024 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i)\u00a0recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii)\u00a0accumulated and communicated to the Company\u2019s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\n\nInherent Limitations over Internal Controls\n\nThe Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. The Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:\n\n(i)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company\u2019s assets;\n\n(ii)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that the Company\u2019s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Company\u2019s management and directors; and\n\n(iii)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nManagement, including the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company\u2019s internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future periods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\nManagement\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control \u2013 Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on the Company\u2019s assessment, management has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September\u00a028, 2024 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. The Company\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an audit report on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting, which appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\n\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nThere were no changes in the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2024, which were identified in connection with management\u2019s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting.\n\nApple Inc. \\| 2024 Form 10-K \\| 51\n\n* * *"
