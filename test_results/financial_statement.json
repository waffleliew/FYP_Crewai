financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with GAAP requires the use of management estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period\u2019s presentation.\n\nThe Company\u2019s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company\u2019s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first fiscal quarter of 2023. The Company\u2019s fiscal years 2024 and 2022 spanned 52 weeks each, whereas fiscal year 2023 spanned 53 weeks. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company\u2019s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.\n\nRevenue\n\nThe Company records revenue net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities.\n\nShare-Based Compensation\n\nThe Company recognizes share-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis for its estimate of equity awards that will ultimately vest.\n\nCash Equivalents\n\nAll highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are treated as cash equivalents.\n\nMarketable Securities\n\nThe cost of securities sold is determined using the specific identification method.\n\nInventories\n\nInventories are measured using the first-in, first-out method.\n\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\n\nDepreciation on property, plant and equipment is recognized on a straight-line basis.\n\nDerivative Instruments\n\nThe Company presents derivative assets and liabilities at their gross fair values in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nIncome Taxes\n\nThe Company records certain deferred tax assets and liabilities in connection with the minimum tax on certain foreign earnings created by the TCJA.\n\nLeases\n\nThe Company combines and accounts for lease and nonlease components as a single lease component for leases of corporate, data center and retail facilities.\n\nApple Inc. \\| 2024 Form 10-K \\| 34\n\n* * *\n\nNote 2 \u2013 Revenue\n\nThe Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it expects to be entitled when control of the products or services is transferred to its customers. Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company\u2019s Products net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company\u2019s Services net sales, control transfers over time as services are delivered. Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period following transfer of control or commencement of delivery of services, as applicable.\n\nThe Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer incentive programs based on the Company\u2019s expectations and historical experience.\n\nFor arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are distinct, the Company allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (\u201cSSPs\u201d). When available, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are established that reflect the Company\u2019s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company\u2019s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation including, where applicable, prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, product-specific business objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation.\n\nThe Company has identified the performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac and iPad. The first material performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second material performance obligation is the right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud\u00ae, Siri\u00ae and Maps. The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts to all of its performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because the Company lacks observable prices for product-related bundled services, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company\u2019s estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which generally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated to product-related bundled services is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided.\n\nFor certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For these arrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that any unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized revenue, and does not disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services.\n\nFor the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when determining whether it obtains control of third-party products, including evaluating if it can establish the price of the product, retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product. For third-party applications sold through the App Store, the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for all third-party application\u2013related sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services net sales only the commission it retains.\n\nNet sales disaggregated by significant products and services for 2024, 2023 and 2022 were as follows (in millions):\n\n|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | 2024 |  | 2023 |  | 2022 |\n| iPhone | $ | 201,183 |  |  | $ | 200,583 |  |  | $ | 205,489 |  |\n| Mac | 29,984 |  |  | 29,357 |  |  | 40,177 |  |\n| iPad | 26,694 |  |  | 28,300 |  |  | 29,292 |  |\n| Wearables, Home and Accessories | 37,005 |  |  | 39,845 |  |  | 41,241 |  |\n| Services (1) | 96,169 |  |  | 85,200 |  |  | 78,129 |  |\n| Total net sales | $ | 391,035 |  |  | $ | 383,285 |  |  | $ | 394,328 |  |\n\n(1)Services net sales include amortization of the deferred value of services bundled in the sales price of certain products.\n\nTotal net sales include $7.7 billion of revenue recognized in 2024 that was included in deferred revenue as of September\u00a030, 2023, $8.2 billion of revenue recognized in 2023 that was included in deferred revenue as of September\u00a024, 2022, and $7.5 billion of revenue recognized in 2022 that was included in deferred revenue as of September\u00a025, 2021.\n\nApple Inc. \\| 2024 Form 10-K \\| 35\n\n* * *\n\nThe Company\u2019s proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was generally consistent for each reportable segment in Note 13, \u201cSegment Information and Geographic Data\u201d for 2024, 2023 and 2022, except in Greater China, where iPhone revenue represented a moderately higher proportion of net sales.\n\nAs of September\u00a028, 2024 and September\u00a030, 2023, the Company had total deferred revenue of $12.8 billion and $12.1\u00a0billion, respectively. As of September\u00a028, 2024, the Company expects 64% of total deferred revenue to be realized in less than a year, 25% within one-to-two years, 9% within two-to-three years and 2% in greater than

The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers. The Company does not reflect the sale of these components in products net sales. Rather, the Company recognizes any gain on these sales as a reduction of products cost of sales when the related final products are sold by the Company. As of September\u00a028, 2024, the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 44% and 23%.

The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as of January 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The recovery amount was calculated to be \u20ac13.1\u00a0billion, plus interest of \u20ac1.2\u00a0billion.\n\nFrom time to time, the Company requested approval from the Irish Minister for Finance to reduce the recovery amount for certain taxes paid to other countries. As of September\u00a028, 2024, the adjusted recovery amount of \u20ac12.7\u00a0billion plus interest of \u20ac1.2\u00a0billion was held in escrow and restricted from general use. The total balance of the escrow, including net unrealized investment gains, was \u20ac14.2\u00a0billion or $15.8\u00a0billion as of September 28, 2024, of which $2.6\u00a0billion was classified as cash and cash equivalents and $13.2\u00a0billion was classified as current marketable securities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

On July 15, 2020, the General Court annulled the State Aid Decision. On September 25, 2020, the Commission appealed the General Court\u2019s decision to the European Court of Justice (the \u201cECJ\u201d) and a hearing was held on May 23, 2023. On September 10, 2024, the ECJ announced that it had set aside the 2020 judgment of the General Court and confirmed the Commission\u2019s 2016 State Aid Decision. As a result, during the fourth quarter of 2024 the Company recorded a one-time income tax charge of $10.2\u00a0billion, net, which represents $15.8\u00a0billion payable to Ireland via release of the escrow, partially offset by a U.S. foreign tax credit of $4.8\u00a0billion and a decrease in unrecognized tax benefits of $823\u00a0million.\n\nProvision for Income Taxes and Effective Tax Rate\n\nThe provision for income taxes for 2024, 2023 and 2022, consisted of the following (in millions):\n\n|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | 2024 |  | 2023 |  | 2022 |\n| Federal: |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Current | $ | 5,571 |  |  | $ | 9,445 |  |  | $ | 7,890 |  |\n| Deferred | (3,080) |  |  | (3,644) |  |  | (2,265) |  |\n| Total | 2,491 |  |  | 5,801 |  |  | 5,625 |  |\n| State: |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Current | 1,726 |  |  | 1,570 |  |  | 1,519 |  |\n| Deferred | (298) |  |  | (49) |  |  | 84 |  |\n| Total | 1,428 |  |  | 1,521 |  |  | 1,603 |  |\n| Foreign: |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Current | 25,483 |  |  | 8,750 |  |  | 8,996 |  |\n| Deferred | 347 |  |  | 669 |  |  | 3,076 |  |\n| Total | 25,830 |  |  | 9,419 |  |  | 12,072 |  |\n| Provision for income taxes | $ | 29,749 |  |  | $ | 16,741 |  |  | $ | 19,300 |  |\n\nForeign pretax earnings were $77.3 billion, $72.9 billion and $71.3 billion in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\nA reconciliation of the provision for income taxes to the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate (21% in 2024, 2023 and 2022) to income before provision for income taxes for 2024, 2023 and 2022, is as follows (dollars in millions):\n\n|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | 2024 |  | 2023 |  | 2022 |\n| Computed expected tax | $ | 25,932 |  |  | $ | 23,885 |  |  | $ | 25,012 |  |\n| State taxes, net of federal effect | 1,162 |  |  | 1,124 |  |  | 1,518 |  |\n| Impact of the State Aid Decision | 10,246 |  |  | \u2014 |  |  | \u2014 |  |\n| Earnings of foreign subsidiaries | (5,311) |  |  | (5,744) |  |  | (4,366) |  |\n| Research and development credit, net | (1,397) |  |  | (1,212) |  |  | (1,153) |  |\n| Excess tax benefits from equity awards | (893) |  |  | (1,120) |  |  | (1,871) |  |\n| Other | 10 |  |  | (192) |  |  | 160 |  |\n| Provision for income taxes | $ | 29,749 |  |  | $ | 16,741 |  |  | $ | 19,300 |  |\n| Effective tax rate | 24.1 | % |  | 14.7 | % |  | 16.2 | % |\n\nApple Inc. \\| 2024 Form 10-K \\| 40\n\n* * *\n\nDeferred Tax Assets and Liabilities\n\nAs of September\u00a028, 2024 and September\u00a030, 2023, the significant components of the Company\u2019s deferred tax assets and liabilities were (in millions):\n\n|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | 2024 |  | 2023 |\n| Deferred tax assets: |  |  |  |\n| Capitalized research and development | $ | 10,739 |  |  | $ | 6,294 |  |\n| Tax credit carryforwards | 8,856 |  |  | 8,302 |  |\n| Accrued liabilities and other reserves | 6,114 |  |  | 6,365 |  |\n| Deferred revenue | 3,413 |  |  | 4,571 |  |\n| Lease liabilities | 2,410 |  |  | 2,421 |  |\n| Unrealized losses | 1,173 |  |  | 2,447 |  |\n| Other | 2,168 |  |  | 2,343 |  |\n| Total deferred tax assets | 34,873 |  |  | 32,743 |  |\n| Less: Valuation allowance | (8,866) |  |  | (8,374) |  |\n| Total deferred tax assets, net | 26,007 |  |  | 24,369 |  |\n| Deferred tax liabilities: |  |  |  |\n| Depreciation | 2,551 |  |  | 1,998 |  |\n| Right-of-use assets | 2,125 |  |  | 2,179 |  |\n| Minimum tax on foreign earnings | 1,674 |  |  | 1,940 |  |\n| Unrealized gains | \u2014 |  |  | 511 |  |\n| Other | 455 |  |  | 490 |  |\n| Total deferred tax liabilities | 6,805 |  |  | 7,118 |  |\n| Net deferred tax assets | $ | 19,202 |  |  | $ | 17,251 |  |\n\nAs of September\u00a028, 2024, the Company had $5.1\u00a0billion in foreign tax credit carryforwards in Ireland and $3.6\u00a0billion in California R&D credit carryforwards, both of which can be carried forward indefinitely.

RSUs granted under the 2022 Plan generally vest over four years, based on continued employment, and are settled upon vesting in shares of the Company\u2019s common stock on a one-for-one basis. All RSUs granted under the 2022 Plan have dividend equivalent rights, which entitle holders of RSUs to the same dividend value per share as holders of common stock. A maximum of approximately 1.3 billion shares were authorized for issuance pursuant to 2022 Plan awards at the time the plan was approved on March 4, 2022.\n\n2014 Employee Stock Plan\n\nThe Apple Inc. 2014 Employee Stock Plan, as amended and restated (the \u201c2014 Plan\u201d), is a shareholder-approved plan that provided for broad-based equity grants to employees, including executive officers. The 2014 Plan permitted the granting of the same types of equity awards with substantially the same terms as the 2022 Plan. The 2014 Plan also permitted the granting of cash bonus awards. In the third quarter of 2022, the Company terminated the authority to grant new awards under the 2014 Plan.\n\nApple Inc. \\| 2024 Form 10-K \\| 44\n\n* * *\n\nRestricted Stock Units\n\nA summary of the Company\u2019s RSU activity and related information for 2024, 2023 and 2022, is as follows:\n\n|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | Number of<br>RSUs<br>(in thousands) |  | Weighted-Average<br>Grant-Date Fair<br>Value Per RSU |  | Aggregate<br>Fair Value<br>(in millions) |\n| Balance as of September 25, 2021 | 240,427 |  |  | $ | 75.16 |  |  |  |\n| RSUs granted | 91,674 |  |  | $ | 150.70 |  |  |  |\n| RSUs vested | (115,861) |  |  | $ | 72.12 |  |  |  |\n| RSUs canceled | (14,739) |  |  | $ | 99.77 |  |  |  |\n| Balance as of September 24, 2022 | 201,501 |  |  | $ | 109.48 |  |  |  |\n| RSUs granted | 88,768 |  |  | $ | 150.87 |  |  |  |\n| RSUs vested | (101,878) |  |  | $ | 97.31 |  |  |  |\n| RSUs canceled | (8,144) |  |  | $ | 127.98 |  |  |  |\n| Balance as of September 30, 2023 | 180,247 |  |  | $ | 135.91 |  |  |  |\n| RSUs granted | 80,456 |  |  | $ | 173.78 |  |  |  |\n| RSUs vested | (87,633) |  |  | $ | 127.59 |  |  |  |\n| RSUs canceled | (9,744) |  |  | $ | 140.80 |  |  |  |\n| Balance as of September 28, 2024 | 163,326 |  |  | $ | 158.73 |  |  | $ | 37,204 |  |\n\nThe fair value as of the respective vesting dates of RSUs was $15.8 billion, $15.9 billion and $18.2 billion for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The majority of RSUs that vested in 2024, 2023 and 2022 were net share settled such that the Company withheld shares with a value equivalent to the employees\u2019 obligation for the applicable income and other employment taxes, and remitted cash to the appropriate taxing authorities. The total shares withheld were approximately 31 million, 37 million and 41 million for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and were based on the value of the RSUs on their respective vesting dates as determined by the Company\u2019s closing stock price. Total payments to taxing authorities for employees\u2019 tax obligations were $5.6 billion in both 2024 and 2023 and $6.4 billion in 2022.\n\nShare-Based Compensation\n\nThe following table shows share-based compensation expense and the related income tax benefit included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for 2024, 2023 and 2022 (in millions):\n\n|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | 2024 |  | 2023 |  | 2022 |\n| Share-based compensation expense | $ | 11,688 |  |  | $ | 10,833 |  |  | $ | 9,038 |  |\n| Income tax benefit related to share-based compensation expense | $ | (3,350) |  |  | $ | (3,421) |  |  | $ | (4,002) |  |\n\nAs of September\u00a028, 2024, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding RSUs was $19.4 billion, which the Company expects to recognize over a weighted-average period of 2.4 years.\n\nNote 12 \u2013 Commitments, Contingencies and Supply Concentrations\n\nUnconditional Purchase Obligations\n\nThe Company has entered into certain off\u2013balance sheet commitments that require the future purchase of goods or services (\u201cunconditional purchase obligations\u201d). The Company\u2019s unconditional purchase obligations primarily consist of supplier arrangements, licensed intellectual property and content, and distribution rights. Future payments under unconditional purchase obligations with a remaining term in excess of one year as of September\u00a028, 2024, are as follows (in millions):\n\n|     |     |     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| 2025 | $ | 3,206 |  |\n| 2026 | 2,440 |  |\n| 2027 | 1,156 |  |\n| 2028 | 3,121 |  |\n| 2029 | 633 |  |\n| Thereafter | 670 |  |\n| Total | $ | 11,226 |  |\n\nApple Inc. \\| 2024 Form 10-K \\| 45\n\n* * *\n\nContingencies\n\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and that have not been fully resolved. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims.\n\nConcentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product\n\nAlthough most components essential to the Company\u2019s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.\n\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\u2019 yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company\u2019s requirements.\n\nSubstantially all of the Company\u2019s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam.\n\nNote 13 \u2013 Segment Information and Geographic Data\n\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company\u2019s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company\u2019s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company\u2019s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region.\n\nThe Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company\u2019s retail stores located in those geographic locations. Operating income for each segment consists of net sales to third parties, related cost of sales, and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at September\u00a028, 2024 and September\u00a030, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September\u00a028, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d).\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\u201cPCAOB\u201d), the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of September\u00a028, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control \u2013 Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated November\u00a01, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n\nBasis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\nCritical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1)\u00a0relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2)\u00a0involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates.\n\n|     |     |     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | Uncertain Tax Positions |\n| Description of the Matter | As discussed in Note 7 to the financial statements, the Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. As of September\u00a028, 2024, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $22.0 billion, of which $10.8 billion, if recognized, would impact the Company\u2019s effective tax rate. In accounting for some of the uncertain tax positions, the Company uses significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws.<br>Auditing management\u2019s evaluation of whether an uncertain tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and the measurement of the benefit of various tax positions can be complex, involves significant judgment, and is based on interpretations of tax laws and legal rulings. |\n\nApple Inc. \\| 2024 Form 10-K \\| 48\n\n* * *\n\n|     |     |     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| How We Addressed the<br>Matter in Our Audit | We tested controls relating to the evaluation of uncertain tax positions, including controls over management\u2019s assessment as to whether tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained, management\u2019s process to measure the benefit of its tax positions that qualify for recognition, and the related disclosures.<br>We evaluated the Company\u2019s assessment of which tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained and the related measurement of the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition. Our audit procedures included, among others, reading and evaluating management\u2019s assumptions and analysis, and, as applicable, the Company\u2019s communications with taxing authorities, that detailed the basis and technical merits of the uncertain tax positions. We involved our tax subject matter resources in assessing the technical merits of certain of the Company\u2019s tax positions based on our knowledge of relevant tax laws and experience with related taxing authorities. For a certain tax position, we also received an external legal counsel confirmation letter and discussed the matter with external advisors and the Company\u2019s tax personnel. In addition, we evaluated the Company\u2019s disclosure in relation to these matters included in Note 7 to the financial statements. |\n\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\n\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2009.\n\nSan Jose, California\n\nNovember\u00a01, 2024\n\nApple Inc. \\| 2024 Form 10-K \\| 49\n\n* * *\n\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\n\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Apple Inc.\n\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nWe have audited Apple Inc.\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of September\u00a028, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control \u2013 Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the \u201cCOSO criteria\u201d). In our opinion, Apple Inc. (the \u201cCompany\u201d) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September\u00a028, 2024, based on the COSO criteria.\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\u201cPCAOB\u201d), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of September\u00a028, 2024 and September\u00a030, 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders\u2019 equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September\u00a028, 2024, and the related notes and our report dated November\u00a01, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n\nBasis for Opinion\n\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\n\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)\u00a0pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)\u00a0provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)\u00a0provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\n\nSan Jose, California\n\nNovember\u00a01, 2024\n\nApple Inc. \\| 2024 Form 10-K \\| 50\n\n* * *"
