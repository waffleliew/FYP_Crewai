### Concluding Summary

The company delivered a robust performance in Q3 2021, driven by strong revenue growth across all business segments and a positive operating environment. However, one-time legal charges impacted the profitability metrics, leading to a negative operating and net margin for the quarter. On a positive note, the company saw substantial growth in cash reserves, suggesting strong liquidity management, and adjusted EPS exceeded expectations. Moving forward, ABM's strategic initiatives, including the acquisition of Able Services, and demand for its virus protection services could play a pivotal role in sustaining growth and improving profitability. The current financial position and strategic outlook provide a solid foundation for continued operational success in the future.
